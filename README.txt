Final Year Project - JavaScript, Jquery, HTML, CSS


Logic Circuit Builder:

This project sought to develop a software environment in order to allow users to build computer logic circuits from simpler circuits. The environment needed to include 
a graphical user interface where users are able to drag, drop and connect logic gates to build a complex circuit. 
The environment also needed to offer the ability to save the circuit, load a previously created circuit and generate a truth table from the circuit.
